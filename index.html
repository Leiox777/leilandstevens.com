        <p id="textclass001">My purpose is to help develop the concepts needed to create a specialized artificial intelligence.
            This artificial intelligence must be capable of general intelligence. A form of intelligence similar to humans.
            I understand the dangers that may come with releasing an artificial super-intelligence into the world.
            A machine of this ability could easily destroy life as we know it, but could just as easily build a utopia.
            The problem is, is that it is inevitable. No matter who you are, the day the machine is created will come.
            I mine as well be the one helping to push the button.
            Currently, I am in the process of developing many programming projects to sharpen my skills.
            A directory of these projects as well as my Github can be found <a href="https://www.google.com/">here.</a>
